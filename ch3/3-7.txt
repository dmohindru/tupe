cat x y >y
cat complaints about file x not found if it does not exists.
cat would also complaints about file y which says input file cannot be output file

cat x >>x
cat would complaints about file x which says input file cannot be output file

In conclusion
cat compares the inode number and the device ID with the input and output, outputs an 
error if both are the same, and ignores the input file
