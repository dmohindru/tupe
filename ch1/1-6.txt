$ wc temp >temp
As seen in excercise 1-5 >file is evaluated first.
So >temp first create empty temp file overwriting existing file temp.
then 'wc temp' reads empty file and outputs
0 0 0 temp

Same can be verified by creating empty file empty_temp and running command
wc empty_temp
0 0 0 empty_temp


$ woh >temp
Again >temp is evaluated first and empty file is created
shell would complaint about woh command not found and print error message
on console and temp will remain empty file.
