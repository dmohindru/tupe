A)
Second version 'here document' would be easy to maintain. Since we have to
maintain only one document. But in case of original document, we have to 
maintain two document.
1. file containing phone data
2. script file containing commands to process phone data.

B)
Original version would be good for general service as data and commands(script file)
are decoupled and thus can cater or modified for indivisual need.
